'description': `I started my undergraduate at Clemson University in fall 2016, not at all confident that I'd be an electrical engineer, but then I found Computer Science. After one introductory course on the track to add it as a minor, I made it my major and never looked back.

I transferred to Coastal Carolina University, which was closer to home, at the start of my junior year and wrapped up my studies on time. I was one class away from a minor in Applied Mathematics, but life got complicated at the wrong time for me and I couldn't quite wrap it up. I had a good experience at Coastal, and would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to get a degree on the coast of South Carolina.`,
